Sports is another. From the legendary Indianapolis 500 to the Pacers and the Colts, the city offers ample opportunities to view professional and amateur sporting events, take part in athletic events and visit sports museums. At the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Hall Of Fame Museum you can tour the famous track (try to reserve tickets if there is a race in town) or visit the museum dedicated to automobiles and auto racing. Other sporty museums include the NCAA Hall of Champions. To get in on some of the action, head to SportZone which features six acres of indoor athletic facilities the whole family will enjoy. Those less interested in sports, or with kids in tow, can still find tons to do in and around the city. History, art and other cultural attractions abound. Visit the Children's Museum or checkout the zoo. Stroll along cobblestone streets past 19th-century buildings in the Lockerbie Square District or visit any number of historic landmarks. Known as the \\\"Crossroads of America,\\\" more interstate highways bisect Indianapolis than any other city in the country, making it an exciting and easily accessible destination.\",\"is_localized_description\":false,\"ancestors\":[{\"subcategory\":[{\"key\":\"state\",\"name\":\"State\"}],\"name\":\"Indiana\",\"abbrv\":\"IN\",\"location_id\":\"28935\"},{\"subcategory\":[{\"key\":\"country\",\"name\":\"Country\"}],\"name\":\"United States\",\"abbrv\":null,\"location_id\":\"191\"}],\"parent_display_name\":\"Indiana\",\"guide_count\":\"0\"},\"scope\":\"local\"},{\"result_type\":\"geos\",\"result_object\":{\"location_id\":\"293860\",\"name\":\"India\",\"latitude\":\"28.584963\",\"longitude\":\"77.21989\",\"timezone\":\"Asia/Kolkata\",\"location_string\":\"India, Asia\",\"photo\":{\"images\":{\"small\":{\"width\":\"150\",\"url\":\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/df/24/c9/abbey-fall-the-falls.jpg\",\"height\":\"150\"},\"thumbnail\":{\"width\":\"50\",\"url\":\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/df/24/c9/abbey-fall-the-falls.jpg\",\"height\":\"50\"},\"original\":{\"width\":\"2000\",\"url\":\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/df/24/c9/abbey-fall-the-falls.jpg\",\"height\":\"1125\"},\"large\":{\"width\":\"550\",\"url\":\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/df/24/c9/abbey-fall-the-falls.jpg\",\"height\":\"309\"},\"medium\":{\"width\":\"250\",\"url\":\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0d/df/24/c9/abbey-fall-the-falls.jpg\",\"height\":\"141\"}},\"is_blessed\":false,\"uploaded_date\":\"2016-12-14T06:07:34-0500\",\"caption\":\"Abbey fall : The falls was earlier called Jessi falls named after a British officer's wife.

The new space, called Riley Children's Health Sports Legends Experience includes basketball, football, hockey, soccer, pedal car racing (drag strip and oval track), golf, baseball, and tennis. The indoor portion of the new area includes the National Art Museum of Sport along with the World of Sport and History of Hoops. The Children's Museum of Indianapolis itself is made up of 500,000 square feet with exhibits and activities that are fun and interesting for the entire family as they explore the physical and natural sciences, history, world cultures and the arts through exciting interactive exhibits on five floors. Families will discover some of the most rare dinosaur fossils in the world and see what it's like to live and work in space. There's also a theater with children's plays and live entertainment.\",\n",
