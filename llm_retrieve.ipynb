      "**Explanation of Choices and Itinerary Flow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Nice (NCE):** Start your trip on the French Riviera with beautiful beaches and a vibrant city atmosphere.  June is ideal for enjoying the coast.\n",
      "* **Ajaccio, Corsica (AJA):** A short flight to Corsica offers stunning mountainous terrain, beautiful beaches, and a unique island culture.  \n",
      "* **Marseille (MRS):**  Another coastal city, Marseille provides a different flavor than Nice, with its historic port and bustling energy.\n",
      "* **Lyon (LYS):** Fly inland to Lyon, a gastronomic capital, offering a change of pace. This also positions you for easier access to the Alps.\n",
      "* **Grenoble (GNB):**  A gateway to the French Alps, Grenoble offers access to hiking, stunning mountain views and charming town squares.\n",
      "* **Annecy (NCY):**  Known as the \"Venice of the Alps,\" Annecy is a picturesque town nestled beside a stunning lake, perfect for relaxation and water activities. Although Annecy has a small airport (NCY) with limited commercial flights, it's more common to fly into Geneva (GVA) in Switzerland and then transfer to Annecy (approximately 45 minutes by road). I have kept Annecy in the Itinerary due to its beauty but be aware of the transfer requirement.\n",
      "* **Chambéry (CMF):** Another Alpine town with a historical center and access to hiking and outdoor activities. Chambéry also has a small airport (CMF) primarily serving seasonal/charter flights.  Consider flying into Lyon (LYS) and traveling to Chambéry by train or car if commercial flights to CMF are limited.\n",
      "* **Paris (CDG):**  Conclude your trip in the iconic city of Paris.  While not a hill station or beach town itself, Paris offers world-class museums, culture, and history.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Airport Codes:** The airport codes provided are the most common for these cities. Double-check flight availability and connections for your specific dates.\n",
      "* **Intercity Travel:** This itinerary assumes you'll fly between most cities.  Consider train travel for shorter distances, especially in the Alps region, for scenic views.\n",
      "* **Accommodation:** Book accommodations in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n",
      "* **Activities:** Research specific activities and attractions in each location based on your interests.\n",
      "* **Flexibility:** This is a suggested itinerary. Feel free to adjust the duration of your stay in each city or add/remove destinations based on your preferences.\n",
