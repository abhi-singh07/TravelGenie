The 2013 season promises to be exhilarating for people who will visit Parc de la Chute-Montmorency \u2013 Montmorency Falls, the second most visited site of the provincial capital after Old Quebec. The highlight of all the new summer activities is certainly the opening of two via ferrata routes built in the Boischatel fault near the waterfalls. Via ferrata \u2013 this is Italian for \u201ciron roads\u201d - is an activity accessible to everyone over 12 years old that combines hiking and rock climbing.
