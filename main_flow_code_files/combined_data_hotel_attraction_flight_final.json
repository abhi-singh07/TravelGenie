We take great pride in providing a fantastic service to our students, so that you have the best possible surfing experience! Suitable for all ages, shapes & sizes!

It's also important to have your lesson on the best possible waves for learning to surf - this makes a huge difference in helping a new surfer do well and have the most fun! I have the exclusive Council permits to provide surf lessons at the 3 best beaches around Caloundra so I can take my classes to the best location. There are Google Maps of all these locations are on my website. I plan the lesson when we will get the best waves, so the time of our class will depend upon the conditions & vary from day to day.

        "description": "\"A Magical Sunshine Coast Experience!\" Take off from the beautiful Maroochy River in our authentic Warbird spyplane and see the world from the perspective of the Dreamtime black swans and be awestruck. This is no ordinary seaplane and no ordinary joy flight. \"Willy\" is designed for observation - she has more glass than a helicopter, excels at flying low and slow, and is the quietest piston-engined aircraft on the planet! Adventure flights are made for 3 passengers only. Each one is personalised - choose where and which adventure and whether you want a 'doors on' or 'doors off' experience. Every passenger has a window seat, Bose Aviation headsets, is able to interact with the pilot and treated to expert commentary. The Sunshine Coast is the ONLY place in the southern hemisphere where you can enjoy this sustainable experience in this type of aircraft! Do not miss it! Flights start at $149 per person. See our marquee at Maroochy River every Thursday through Monday 9am-3pm.",
